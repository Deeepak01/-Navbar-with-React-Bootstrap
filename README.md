import { Navbar, Nav } from 'react-bootstrap';

const MyNavbar = () => {
  return (
    <Navbar bg="light" expand="lg">
      <Navbar.Brand href="#home">Brand</Navbar.Brand>
      <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
      <Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
        <Nav className="me-auto">
          <Nav.Link href="#home">Home</Nav.Link>
          <Nav.Link href="#link">Link</Nav.Link>

## Customization

Feel free to customize the navbar according to your needs. You can change colors, fonts, and links by modifying the CSS or the component structure. Here are a few suggestions:

```

```css
.navbar {
  background-color: #282c34;
